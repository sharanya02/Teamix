## üß∞ Tools and Technologies used

Teamix is a desktop application made with  electron.js. There is also a central server and a database in a typical three tier architecture system. The app and the server communicate through http requests and follow RESTful standards.

**Backend service:**
- PostgreSQL for database.
- Node.js
- Jitsi Web RTC for video calling

**Frontend service:**
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Electron to package the desktop application



## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
- To run development server, first **cd into the backend directory** then run -
```bash
npm run dev
```
- To run electron app, cd into the **frontend directory** then run -
```bash
npm run electron
```
- To lint code
```bash
npm run lint
```
- To run unit tests
```bash
npm run test
```

## üíª Project Methodology

The software was developed using **scrum framework** in **agile methodology**. 
</br></br>
This was done to ensure that the main focus was on the software product. The exact list of features were not exactly known since the start and hence it was very necessary that the whole process was able to accommodate change easily. 
</br></br>
The project was released in 2 sprints, and each sprint was further divided into 3 phases-

- Planning and prototyping: I used a method of prototyping by first designing the UI on Figma and then after final approval, the implementation of it on the desktop application
- Implementation
- Testing and review: After each sprint, I discussed my progress with my mentors, and improved my project based on their feedback.

## üìà Deployment

The backend is deployed using **Heroku**. The deployment follows a CI/CD pipeline in which, a successful push to the main branch of the github repository runs a github action which in turn runs a series of unit tests which were written, and only on passing the tests successfully the latest code is deployed to Heroku.
